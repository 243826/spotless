# Contributing to Spotless

Pull requests are welcome, preferably against `master`.

## Build instructions

The easiest way to work on Spotless is to run `gradlew ide`.  It will download and setup an Eclipse IDE for you, using [goomph](https://github.com/diffplug/goomph).

You can also use Spotless like any other standard Gradle build.

`gradlew eclipse`
* creates an Eclipse project file for you.

`gradlew build`
* builds the jar
* runs the tests
